This project will be used to manage a system that monitors the status of a set of electronically measured water tanks. The embedded circuit attached to each water tank will measure the height of the water in the tank and report on the tank's current occupancy as a percentage of its maximum capacity.

The RESTful API is designed to allow each IoT enabled water tank to interface with the server so that the measured values can be represented visually on a web page. It also supports the maintenance of a simple user profile. The web page will be designed by another member of the team. 

The server performs the actions of a simple HTTP web server. It performs actions on a resource such as Create, Read, Update and Delete. This was done without the use of a database.
